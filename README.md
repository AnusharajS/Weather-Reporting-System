# Weather-Reporting-System
As a part of Internet of Things (IoT) lab, a **Weather Reporting System** was built.

The Weather Reporting system senses various parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure etc and plots the values as a graph for users to visualize how the parameters varied in a particular period of time. A machine learning model was also built which predicts the parameter values for next few minutes from the past measured values.

OpenweatherAPI was also used which helps in providing values/information of various weather parameters of a particular region or area.

Overall, this system can be deployed anywhere where it reports the weather parameters sensed through sensors and also gives the weather information of the locality where it is used.
